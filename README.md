# Recap Project 1 & 2: Quiz App 

This project was my first mobile web application - a quiz app.
The layout is created with HTML and CSS, the interactivity with JavaScript.

The app contains a page with a list of question cards with clickable buttons to look up anwers, a bookmark page with saved questions cards, a form to create new question cards, as well as a profile page.
